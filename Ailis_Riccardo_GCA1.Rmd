# Abstract {#abstract}

### Aim and Rationale

- This study evaluates the effectiveness of Virtual Reality (VR) therapy compared to traditional
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) in reducing depression symptoms.


### Participants and Setting

- A total of 200 participants aged 18–40 were randomly assigned to either a control group receiving traditional CBT or
an experimental group receiving VR therapy.


### Experiment Design

- Depression levels were measured using the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) at the start and end of a 12-week
treatment period.


### Results Gathering

- Statistical analyses, including independent and paired t-tests, were conducted to compare changes in depression scores
between the two groups.


### Findings/Implications

- The findings suggest that VR therapy demonstrated a greater reduction in symptoms, highlighting the evolving role
of immersive technologies in mental health interventions.


# Introduction {#introduction}

### Topic and Context

- Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health disorders worldwide. Traditional treatment approaches,
such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), have demonstrated efficacy in managing depressive symptoms.


### Theoretical Framework

- Advancements in technology have opened new avenues for therapy delivery, including Virtual Reality (VR)-based interventions.


### Rationale

- VR therapy provides interactive, simulated environments that can be tailored to the patients needs.
These environments enable exposure therapy, stress management, and mood enhancement in ways that traditional methods cannot replicate.


### Hypothesis

- The hypothesis is that VR therapy will lead to a significantly greater reduction in depression scores compared to CBT.


# Method {#method}

### Participants

- 200 participants, 95 males and 105 females, aged between 18 and 40 years;
two groups (100 participants each), traditional CBT and Experimental VR-based therapy.


### Design

- Randondomized controlled design, depression in clinic patients;
Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) at the start and end of a 12-week treatment period.


### Materials

- Zung SDS, A 20-item questionnaire measuring depression severity, 4-point Likert scale (1 Low 4 High) with scores from 20 to 80;
VR Equipment, custom immersive environments with therapeutic interventions;
CBT Sessions, defined protocol.


### Procedure

- 12 weekly therapy sessions, each lasting 50 minutes.
VR: VR application designed to simulate therapeutic environments;
CBT: cognitive restructuring and behavioral activation techniques.
Zung SDS performed at the beginning and the end of the 12-week period.


# Results {#results}

### Descriptive Statistics

- For the control group (CBT), the average pre-treatment score was 60.0 (SD = 7.11), which decreased to an
average post-treatment score of 50.0.
Similarly, the experimental group (VR) showed an average pre-treatment score of 55.0 (SD = 7.11),
decreasing to 45.0 post-treatment.


### Inferential Statistics

- To determine the significance of observed changes in post treatment scores.
T-tests, both independent on post-treatment scores and paired on pre/post scores.
Confidence intervals to further confirm the reliability of the observed results.


### Statistical Tests

- Also, various plots were utilized to properly visualize the behavior of the two groups:

- Box Plots, Bar Charts, Line Graphs, Scatterplots, Confidence Intervals.

### Magnitude and Direction of Results

- While both groups showcased improvement, VR patients showed a slightly greater improvement.
In particular, looking at the graph and plots, the reduced spread of the post-treatment scores
in the experimental patients also suggests a more consistent improvement pattern in the patients undergoing the VR treatment.


# Discussion {#discussion}

### Findings and Relation to the Hypothesis

- Interpret findings and discuss whether they support or refute the hypothesis.


### Limitations

- Discuss any limitations, confounding variables, or methodological constraints.

### NOTE 2: please run the code by manually selecting from line 159 to 320. We tried to set up a chunk but it was breaking knitting

# Check for need to clean data

### Check the structure of the dataset
str(participants_data_final_1_)  

### Get summary statistics
summary(participants_data_final_1_)  

### Count missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(participants_data_final_1_));

### Remove duplicate rows
participants_data_final_1_ <- participants_data_final_1_[!duplicated(participants_data_final_1_), ];

### Convert Group and Gender to factors to check data types
participants_data_final_1_$Group <- as.factor(participants_data_final_1_$Group)
